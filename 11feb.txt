Here are the Linux commands to achieve this step by step:

Step 1: Create data.txt and Write 5 Random Numbers
bash
Copy
Edit
for i in {1..5}; do echo $((RANDOM % 100)) >> data.txt; done
Generates 5 random numbers (between 0-99)
Writes them one per line into data.txt
Step 2: Copy data.txt to backup.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
cp data.txt backup.txt
Copies data.txt to backup.txt
Step 3: Rename data.txt to original.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
mv data.txt original.txt
Renames data.txt to original.txt
Step 4: Display Contents of original.txt and backup.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Contents of original.txt:"
cat original.txt

echo "Contents of backup.txt:"
cat backup.txt
Prints the contents of both original.txt and backup.txt
Final One-Liner Command
You can combine all steps into a single command:

bash
Copy
Edit
for i in {1..5}; do echo $((RANDOM % 100)) >> data.txt; done && cp data.txt backup.txt && mv data.txt original.txt && echo "Contents of original.txt:" && cat original.txt && echo "Contents of backup.txt:" && cat backup.txt
This will execute all steps at once in Linux. ðŸš€
















Ques 2 :- Create 3 file fileA.txt , fileB.txt , file3.txt containing a sentence in all three files 

Combine the three files into a single file combine.txt 

Split combined.txt in two files - Store the first two sentence in one file new.txt and the remaining 

In newfile1.txt 

Display the contents of both files

Here are the Linux commands to complete the task step by step:

Step 1: Create fileA.txt, fileB.txt, file3.txt and Write a Sentence in Each
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "This is the first sentence from fileA." > fileA.txt
echo "This is the second sentence from fileB." > fileB.txt
echo "This is the third sentence from file3." > file3.txt
Creates three files with one sentence each.
Step 2: Combine fileA.txt, fileB.txt, file3.txt into combine.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
cat fileA.txt fileB.txt file3.txt > combine.txt
Merges all three files into combine.txt
Step 3: Split combine.txt into new.txt (first two sentences) and newfile1.txt (remaining)
bash
Copy
Edit
head -n 2 combine.txt > new.txt
tail -n +3 combine.txt > newfile1.txt
head -n 2 â†’ Extracts the first two sentences into new.txt
tail -n +3 â†’ Extracts the remaining sentence(s) into newfile1.txt
Step 4: Display Contents of new.txt and newfile1.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Contents of new.txt:"
cat new.txt

echo "Contents of newfile1.txt:"
cat newfile1.txt
Prints the contents of both files.
Final One-Liner Command
You can execute all steps at once with:

echo "This is the first sentence from fileA." > fileA.txt && echo "This is the second sentence from fileB." > fileB.txt && echo "This is the third sentence from file3." > file3.txt && cat fileA.txt fileB.txt file3.txt > combine.txt && head -n 2 combine.txt > new.txt && tail -n +3 combine.txt > newfile1.txt && echo "Contents of new.txt:" && cat new.txt && echo "Contents of newfile1.txt:" && cat newfile1.txt
