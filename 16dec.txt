if we want to make 100 folders in directory---
mkdir folder{1..10}------ this will create folders from 1 to 10


ls -l  ==== all the files are listed in list order
relative path====  current directory me path
absolute path === starts with root 


mkdir folder{1..10} ---- this will create file from 1 to 10
rmdir folder{1..10} --- this will delete all folder from 1 to 10

file creation in cat...


cat---

-----there is greater than symbol used here > ....

using the ctrl+d ---
we will get removed from the file...




USING CAT---
step1.> first we need to write cat >file1.txt 
by using this we can write the content in the cat file and then---
we can press ctrl + d in order to exit from the file...

step2...> if we needed to add more lines in that.. 
then we can do like cat >>file1.txt
and then we can type and then again in order to exit we can do ---
ctrl + d..



STEP3.> if we want to want the content inside the cat-- then we can do like this...
cat file1.txt --- we can see the inner content..




COMBINATION OF TWO FILES--
WE CAN MERGE TWO FILES USING ----

cat file1 file2 > file3

using this .. all the content of file1 and file2 is copied in the file3...

watching the content of file
if we want to see the content of the file linewise.. then we can use 
cat - n file3.txt 
this will present all the data of file in lines...i.e in numbering order...
