to find the length of a string in linux --
 ${#string}  --it will find the lenght of a string 



in order to declare an array ---

marks=(25 72 61 43 83) 

if we want to access the elements at specific index 
{marks[0]} 

if we want to print all the elements of array --- {marks[@]}

if we want to find the length of the array --- {#marks[@]} --basically just write # before the it....
