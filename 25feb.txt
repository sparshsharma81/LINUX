we make a file and then make a funciton in that file and then in another file we gonna call the function


#!/bin/bash
x=22
y=11
add(){
    echo "$1 + $2 = $(($1 + $2))"

}
multiply(){
    echo "$1 * $2 = $(($1 * $2))"

}
divide(){
    echo "$1 / $2 = $(($1 / $2))"
}


---NOW MAKING ANOTHER FILE 
AND MAKE THEM EXECUTABLE 


in order to import the file --- it is used as 
source ./calc_functions.sh

OR 

. ./calc_functions.sh

cat.proc.filesystems --- using this we know our kernal support which file system..

by default the file system is ext4 --
all the spaces are inside the ext4
