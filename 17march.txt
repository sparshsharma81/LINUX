create the operator 1 user and confirm that it exists in the system.
set the password for operator1. create the additional operator2 and operators3 users.
set their password as well.
run the usermod -c command to update the comments of the operator1 user account.
remove the operator3 user from the system.




Here are the Linux commands to achieve each step:

Step 1: Create the operator1 user
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo useradd operator1
Step 2: Confirm that operator1 exists
bash
Copy
Edit
getent passwd operator1
(If operator1 exists, this will return a line with user details.)

Step 3: Set the password for operator1
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo passwd operator1
(Enter the password when prompted.)

Step 4: Create operator2 and operator3 users
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo useradd operator2
sudo useradd operator3
Step 5: Set passwords for operator2 and operator3
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo passwd operator2
sudo passwd operator3
Step 6: Update comments for operator1 using usermod -c
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo usermod -c "Primary system operator" operator1
Step 7: Remove the operator3 user
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo userdel operator3
(If you also want to remove their home directory, use sudo userdel -r operator3.)



NOW AFTER THIS....
YOU NEED TO MOUNT DEFAULT FILE SYSTEM IN A directory

sudo mount df -h ///default file system present









1. Identify the Default File System
Run the following command to check the default file system type:

bash
Copy
Edit
df -T
This will list all mounted file systems and their types. The default file system is usually ext4, xfs, or btrfs.

2. Create a Mount Point
A mount point is a directory where the file system will be mounted. Create one using:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir /mnt/defaultfs
3. Find the Default File System's Device
Use:

bash
Copy
Edit
lsblk
or

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo blkid
The root file system (/) is usually mounted on /dev/sdaX (where X is a number).

4. Mount the File System
To mount the default file system to the directory /mnt/defaultfs:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/defaultfs
Replace /dev/sdaX with the correct partition name.

5. Verify the Mount
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
df -hT
Check if /mnt/defaultfs is listed with the correct file system.

6. (Optional) Make the Mount Persistent
To ensure the file system mounts automatically on boot, add an entry in /etc/fstab:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add this line at the end:

bash
Copy
Edit
/dev/sdaX  /mnt/defaultfs  ext4  defaults  0  2
Then save and exit.

Unmount the File System (if needed)
If you want to unmount it:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo umount /mnt/defaultfs
