uniq command is applied on sorted list
uniq command operates line by line

like when it goes to first line and then it goes to second line and then it will not find the duplicate 
elements so it will not skip and print everything 


if we do sorting then all the same elements are adjacent...
so for using uniq , we want that the duplicate elements are supposed to be removed 
so for that all the elements are supposed to be sorted in order to work properly
else it will remove only duplicate adjacent elements 




ps -- list of all running processes 
like when we open firebox or any such,,then everything process has a unique id..
ps will list all those processes 



we are given two files 
f1.txt 
f2.txt 

we need to skip the repeated words in the file need to store 
the output after skipping new output in f3.txt 


echo "apple banana mango orange" >file1.txt
echo "orange mango peach apple graphes" > file2.txt

cat file1.txt file2.txt tr ' ' '/n' | sort | uniq >file3.txt 

tr ' ' '\n' --- convert space-separated words into new-line separated words 


----this command will first sort and then remove the duplicate element 
basically from both of the files remove duplicate elements
